# This pulls a VM image "gusztavvargadr/docker-linux" from public Vagrant box that has been pre-configured on Ubuntu OS with docker installed
# In additional, a secondary nic interface with external IP address 192.168.2.48 will be created and it will bridge to physical wifi network
# Note 1: The external IP address allows us to connect to this VM directly from our router network
# Note 2: The ip address 192.168.2.48 needs to be an valid ip address from your home router network
